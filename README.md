# Lung-Cancer-CT-Cancer-Machine-Learning

# Objective Project:
Lung cancer is one of the deadliest diseases that has a significant impact on public health worldwide. Early detection of lung cancer plays a crucial role in improving patient survival rates. Currently, examination using CT scan images is one of the commonly used diagnostic methods to detect potential tumors or abnormalities in the lungs.

With the advancement of technology, machine learning approaches have shown great potential in improving accuracy and efficiency in the diagnostic process. This project aims to combine the power of machine learning with CT scan image data to create a more advanced lung cancer early detection system.

In this project, we will utilize machine learning technology to develop a model capable of automatically identifying patterns or anomalies that may be associated with the presence of tumors or signs of lung cancer in CT scan images. Through this approach, it is hoped that the diagnosis process can be made faster, more accurately, and provide significant benefits to healthcare practitioners and patients.

project aims to develop and implement a machine learning model in the field of computer vision that can process CT scan images of lung cancer. The main focus of this project is to classify the types of lung cancer and normal lung status based on CT scan images. The labels to be used for classification include `Squamous Cell Carcinoma`, `Adenocarcinoma`, `Normal Lung`, and `Large Cell Carcinoma`.

This project not only creates an innovative technological solution, but is also humanitarian in nature as it can help in detecting lung cancer at an early stage, which in turn can improve the cure rate and quality of life of patients. With this project, we hope to make a positive contribution to the prevention and control of lung cancer, bringing positive impacts in the medical world and public health at large.
